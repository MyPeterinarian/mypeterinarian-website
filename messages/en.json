Although she was a bit anxious to start with, the staff at MyPeterinarian quickly tried to bring her some comfort (in the form of treats). They took care of all the grooming (nails, bath, trim, etc.) having Nora all ready for spring. A couple days have passed and she still smells amazing, and more importantly seems to have had a good experience with grooming.",

While we were at Tivoli Pepper not just only had a great day with his sitter, but also got a dog bath. They sent us plenty of photos and updates during the day and Pepper was really happy when we picked him up. They even asked if we wanted to get a veterinary check because they noticed he had an ear infection. This place cares a lot about dogs and the experience made our visit to Copenhagen much easier. If we ever go back I'll absolutely use their services again. Highly recommended.",
